Running git diff followed by two commit IDs will compare the two versions of the code in those commits.
git log --stat : gives statistics on which files have changed
in each commit
git reset --hard : takes out files that were to be tracked
set in the staging area and gets rid of them
git status: checks on the current status of your repository
and lets you know what files aren't being tracked, which ones
are, and which commits are in the staging area.
git init: creates a .git file for a directory and changes
it to a local repository
git add: places the commits you want to make to the repository
in the staging area to be added
git commit: moves commits ready to be committed from the staging
area and commits them officially

git diff ( with no argument): compares the working area to the staging area
shows any changes that haven't been added to the staging area
git diff --staged : compares the repository and the staging area
Remember that the staging area is a copy of the most recent commits
until there has been changes added from CWD to the staging area
