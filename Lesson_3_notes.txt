What is forking? We are allowed to clone a remote to our computer and make
it a local repository. We can then reclone it as a modified repository from
our local computer ( does it need to be modified with new branches? I am sure,
most likely not) to Github as a new remote. That new remote can then be cloned
by someone else. This essentially loses the initial author along the process.
However, Forking is a term that is introduced to allow for the cloning of a
remote repository on Github to a new remote on your account. The forking process
takes place with the simple click of a button called "Fork". This also links to
the initial remote repository and gives credit to the initial author. You can then
clone that remote as a local repository if you want.
What is Conflicting Collaboration? If there is commits not yet pushed to the remote
repository and a pull occurs (* Seriously, remember that a pull should only be done when there
are no changes to commit to the remote from local)-- a pull is where a remote commits are being updated
to the local since there have been changes done to the remote and the local has not been updated
with such changes. This situation is considered a conflicting collaboration.
To remediate, you should merge a local and remote version of the branch that has conflicting collaboration.
This can only happen when there changes to both the remote and local, and you cant push or pull without deleting
certain changes.
What does bash <file> < Fork URL> do in command prompt? It clones the changes <file> that a contributor has made to your
remote to your local repository. The ideal is to not have the need to pull changes from the remote to the local and lose
the commits one has already made on the local repository
